## Overview

In [CS61B](https://sp21.datastructur.es/), we’re also concerned with engineering. An engineer, it is said, is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar. Much of CS 61B will be concerned with the tradeoffs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data. We’ll also be concerned with the *engineering* knowledge and skills needed to build and maintain moderately large programs.
